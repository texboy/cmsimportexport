# Magento 2 Module Cms Import Export

This module enables the import and export via csv of CMS content (Block and Pages).
To use it, install it in your project and the "CMS Page" and "CMS Bloc" options will be available in the "System -> Import/Export" menu.

# TO-DO

- Add sample csv files
- Refactor code 
- Add unit tests (honestly, should have done them from the start)
